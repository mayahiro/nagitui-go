# Standard widget gallery

This example demonstrates standard widgets: `List`, `Button`,
`ConfirmDialog`, `Disclosure`, `Progress`, and `Spinner`. It also shows
application-owned state and a clock-driven spinner subscription

The ConfirmDialog explicitly makes Cancel its default action, exposes lazy
controlled details, wraps its actions to the current terminal width, and
returns focus to the opener when application state removes it

Run it from the Go repository root:

```sh
go run ./examples/widget-gallery
```

The first list item is focused at startup. Use Tab and Shift-Tab to move focus,
arrow keys to navigate the list, and Enter or Space to activate buttons. The
list and buttons also accept mouse clicks. Press Q, Escape, or Control-C to exit
