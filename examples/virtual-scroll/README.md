# Virtual scroll

This example declares one million rows while constructing semantic Nodes only
for the resolved visible cell range

Run it from the Go repository root:

```sh
go run ./examples/virtual-scroll
```

The builder receives `VirtualViewport`, creates stable row IDs for its visible
range, and returns a `VirtualFragment` whose origin matches that range. Use
PageUp, PageDown, Home, End, or the mouse wheel to scroll. Press Q or Escape to
exit
